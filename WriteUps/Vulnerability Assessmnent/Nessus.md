# Nessus:
Nessus is a vulnerability assesment tool developed by Tenable Network Security:

## Setting up nessus:
Follow these guidelines to get started with Nessus.
### Downloading Nesus:
You can download Nessus [here](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus?loginAttempted=true). Make sure you're downloading the version that is suitable for your OS. Since i'm using kali linux which is Debian based, i downloaded Linux-Ubuntu-amd64 version.
To check for the file integrity after downloading run ```md5sum Nessus-10.7.1-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb``` and confirm if the md5 hash matches the one on their website.
### Installing Nessus on Debian:
To install Nessus run ```dpkg -i Nessus-10.7.1-ubuntu1404_amd64.deb```
### Starting the Nessus Service:
```sudo systemctl nessusd.service```

By default Nessus runs on port 8334 so we can access it on ```https://localhost:8334``` in our browser.
Follow the instructions in your browser to register. If you want to register for the free service, select Nessus Essentials.

Once you get your activation code, create account, and have the necessary plugins downloaded then you're ready to start

## Scanning with nessus:
To start a vulnerability scan, click on create new scan

### Vulnerability Scans are divided into:
#### Discovery:
![Discovery](https://github.com/bugkay101/HTB/assets/149082141/d309941f-0587-47fd-8893-5e335de40e37)

#### Vulnerabilities:

#### Compliance:

## Host Discovery Scan:
Under host discovery we can perform we can perform Host Enumeration, OS Identification, Port Scans, and even Create our own Custom Scan. 

We Can also add some settings to our scan like tuning the report to our taste.

We can also schedule automated scans to be run daily, but this can be done only once using nessus essentials

There are also advanced settings to aid the scan perfomance or to help with file search on unix and windows systems

To start an host discovery scan, just create a scan, select the host discovery template, fill in a name for your scan and an ip range for your targets, choose a scan type, put in your preferred settings, save the settings and then you can launch the scan.

Here's an example of a port scan i ran on my machine:

![port-scan](https://github.com/bugkay101/HTB/assets/149082141/64c0e281-8d6c-401e-8814-0e902a9f2a82)

Here we can see four hosts are live and 2 ports are open, port 8834 has the nessus service running on it, and port 53 has the DNS server running. We can also check the vulnerabilities tab for the vulnerability report.

## Basic Network Scan:
The Basic Network Scan is classified under the vulnerabilities template. It performs a full system scan on our target. We can also perform authenticated scans if we're given credentials during an internal pentest.

Setting up a Basic Network Scan is quite similar to setting up an Host Discovery Scan.

Fill in a name for your scan and input your targets.

Unlike the normal Host Discovery Scan, the Nessus Basic Network Scan has an Assessment setting option where you can specify how deep you want to go as regards to scanning for web vulnerabilities. You can tune this up to your satisfaction

You can also decide to run an authenticated scan if you have the necessary credentials for it.

Here's the result from a Basic Network Scan that i ran from HackTheBox [Vulnerability Assesment Lab](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjZ6rGWmN-EAxVYSUEAHS5OAiUQFnoECA4QAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademy.hackthebox.com%2Fcourse%2Fpreview%2Fvulnerability-assessment&usg=AOvVaw3YGhdexRhsv9xDv5aK__sQ&opi=89978449)

We can see that the vulnerabilities are classified by severity (critical, high, medium, low, and informative).

To get more information about a vulnerability, go to the vulnerabilities tab and click on the particular vulnerability you want to look into

![BN2](https://github.com/bugkay101/HTB/assets/149082141/a782051f-614d-4106-b573-29002c0b8053)

This shows us more information about the vulnerability and gives us solutions on how to mitigate or patch the vulnerability.

Thanks for reading, I hope you learnt something.
